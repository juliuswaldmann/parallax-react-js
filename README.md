# parallax-react

## Introduction

A libary for managing scroll speed of different components in react.

I recently found myself creating a site in react together with a friend and wanting to implement a parallax effect.
We tried a few different libaries, pure css and everything else but it just did not work.

So we decided to create our own.

## Installation
### Using npm
You can install parallax-react normally through npm: (note: not yet available)

 `
 npm install parallax-react
 `
### Manual installation
Alternatively you can also install parallax-react directyl from the source code:

1. clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/juliuswaldmann/parallax-react.git`
2. open a terminal inside of the repository folder
3. compile the package with `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json`
4. go to the project folder you want to install the package to and open a terminal
5. run `npm install CLONED_REPOSITORY_FOLDER` where `CLONED_REPOSITORY_FOLDER` is the path to the repository you just cloned.
