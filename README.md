# parallax-react

## Introduction

A libary for managing scroll speed of different components in react.

I recently found myself creating a site in react and wanting to implement a parallax effect.
We tried a few different libaries, pure css and everything else but it just did not work.

So we decided to create our own.

### Installation

you can install parallax-react normally through npm (note: not yet available)
```npm install parallax-react```
